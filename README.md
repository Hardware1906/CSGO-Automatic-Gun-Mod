  How to Uninstall:                                                            
     Go to Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\addons     
     Locate the file named 'autoweap' and delete it.                             
                                                                                  
  Alternatively you can locate a file named 'addonlist' located in Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo
    Open that file and set the '1' next to autoweap to a '0'                     
                                                                                  
  If you are unable to locate your CSGO folder, right click CSGO in your Steam library, click Properties, select the Local Files section
    and select the Browse Local Files option.
