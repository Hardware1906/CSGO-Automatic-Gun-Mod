    # Note: Do not join vanilla servers while this mod is active as you will be automatically kicked by sv_pure. 
    You cannot be VAC banned for using this mod. 
    Playing offline with bots or in a private game with friends both work assuming all players have the mod installed.                                 



How to Install mod:                                                            
   Go to Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\addons
   If there isn't "addons" folder, you can create new one
     
   Then paste "autoweap" to this folder
   
   DONE, you did it, now launch CSGO and enjoy

  How to Uninstall:                                                            
     Go to Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\addons     
     Locate the file named 'autoweap' and delete it.                             
                                                                                  
  Alternatively you can locate a file named 'addonlist' located in Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo
    Open that file and set the '1' next to autoweap to a '0'                     
                                                                                  
  *If you are unable to locate your CSGO folder, right click CSGO in your Steam library, click Properties, select the Local Files section
    and select the Browse Local Files option.*
